<h2> Ingredients </h2>

<h1> Directions </h1>
<ol>
  <li> Peel the potatoes and cut into 1/2 -inch dice.
    <ul>

      <li> Place in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water.  </li>
      <li> Set over high heat, cover and bring to a boil.   </li>
      <li> Once boiling, uncover, decrease the heat to maintain a simmer and cook until tender and easily crushed with tongs, approximately 10 to 15 minutes.   </li>
      <li> Microwave half and half butter, drain potatoes and mash them. Then mix with the butter until smooth and stir in yolk.  </li>
      </li>
    </ul>
  <li> Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. </li>
  <li> Prepare the filling.
    <ul>

      <li> Place the canola oil into a 12-inch saute pan and set over medium high heat. </li>
      <li> Once the oil shimmers, add the onion and saute just until they begin to take on color, approximately 3 to 4 minutes.  </li>
      <li>  Add the garlic and stir to combine. Add the lamb, salt and pepper and cook until browned and cooked through, approximately 3 minutes.  </li>
      <li>  Add the tomato paste, chicken broth, Worcestershire, rosemary, thyme, and stir to combine.  </li>
      <li> Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer slowly 10 to 12 minutes or until the sauce is thickened slightly. </li>
      </li>
    </ul>
  <li> Add the corn to the lamb mixture and spread evenly into an 11 by 7 inch glass baking dish.
    <ul>

      <li> Top with the mashed potatoes, starting around the edges to create a seal to prevent the mixture from bubbling up and smooth with a rubber spatula.  </li>
      <li> Place on a parchment lined half sheet pan on the middle rack of the oven and bake for 25 minutes or just until the potatoes begin to brown.  </li>
      <li> Remove to a cooling rack for at least 15 minutes before serving. </li>
