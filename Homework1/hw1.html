<h1> Giovanni - Computer Information Systems </h1>
<p> I am taking this course because it is required for my major and it would be a good idea to also learn some HTML. I'd like to create my own website at some point in my life too because I enjoy travelling and would like to uplaod pictures with maybe a blog and or sell pictures on the website. </p>

<h2> The HTML Elements I Know </h2>

  <ul>
    <li> The Image Embed element
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img" target = "_blank">Official Documentation</a></li>

<h2> Reflection </h2>
<p> The past three weeks in class have been very helpful and I have learned so much about html already! I really appreciate how the class all goes at the same pace so far as the newbies get adjusted to this tough format. I have found that nested loops become extremely cconfusing without the proper actions taken to minimize interference. I hope to learn more about CSS because they seem interesting with all the new things you can use with HTML. Great class so far!</p>
<p> I'm pumped to get to work on the project creating our own website because it has been something I've wanted to do for awhile. I hope to take this knowledge from class and turn it into an outside of class hobby, constantly checking out and improving my webiste for the general public eye. A little far fetched? Maybe. We'll see... </p>
